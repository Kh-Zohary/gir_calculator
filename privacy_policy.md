Welcome to GIR calculator app for Android!

This is an Android app developed by Kh Alzohry. The app is also available on Google Play.

This app is an information tool only and not a substitute for competent medical advisors.

As an avid Android user myself, I take privacy very seriously. I know how irritating it is when apps collect your data without your knowledge.

I have not programmed this app to collect any personally identifiable information. All data created by the app is stored on your device only, and can be simply erased by clearing the app's data or uninstalling it.

If you find any security vulnerability that has been inadvertently caused by the app, or have any question regarding how the app protectes your privacy, please send me an email and I will surely try to fix it/help you.

Yours sincerely,
Kh Alzohry.
